What is FOTA ?
Firmware-over-the-air is a technology
that enables the operating firmware of a
device to be upgraded and updated
wirelessly over the network (“over the
air”) without the need to connect directly
to the device.

Why we choose FOTA ?
Firmware Over-The-Air (FOTA) is an indispensable tool
in the world of IoT, especially in scenarios where
numerous interconnected devices demand frequent
updates.
Consider a different scenario: A global fleet
management company relies on FOTA to enhance its
GPS tracking devices. With FOTA, they can remotely
deploy critical firmware updates to thousands of
devices across the globe. This not only saves time and
resources but also ensures that all devices are up-to-
date with the latest features and security patches,
ultimately improving the overall service quality and
customer satisfaction. Without FOTA, they would face
the daunting task of physically retrieving and updating
each device, leading to logistical challenges and
customer inconvenience.
